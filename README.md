# ðŸ’¤ Neovim Config.

A [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) based config.
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Why LazyVim?

LazyVim is a Neovim distro that doesn't hide what's it doing or create a wrapper that complicates things. Things that work in Neovim work for LazyVim.
I found myself enjoying the pros starting with LazyVim and building off of it rather than starting from scratch as the most of the features are what I am looking for.
